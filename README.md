“Listify”
Project Members:

Project Description:
A comprehensive to-do application allowing users to add, delete, and update personal tasks and check off tasks once completed. Tasks information will be stored in a firebase backend. When users create a task, they can optionally add a picture from the camera relevant to their task. A login page is prompted on the first boot-up of the app, storing the user information along with the tasks associated with that user.
